# Riak Playground

This is my dumping ground for mucking around with riak

## Getting Started

Ripple requires ActiveSupport (and Model?) from Rails 3. To get everything installed:

    gem install gem install tzinfo builder memcache-client rack rack-test rack-mount erubis mail text-format thor bundler i18n
    gem install rack-mount --version "~> 0.4.0"
    gem install rails --pre
    gem install ripple
